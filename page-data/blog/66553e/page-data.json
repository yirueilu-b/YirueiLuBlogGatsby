It's a lightweight comments widget built on GitHub issues. This post is for taking a note of how to use it with React App and Github page.\r\n\r\n## Install Utterances\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/rpGDKAu.png)\r\n\r\nInstalling Utterances is super simple, just need few clicks and everything is done.\r\n\r\n- Install the Utterances Github App to let the Utterances bot access your repository.\r\n\r\n    [Install Utterances Github App here](https://github.com/apps/utterances)\r\n\r\n- After Installing the App, get the Utterances scripts which should be included in the page later.\r\n\r\n    [Check this page for auto generated script settings](https://utteranc.es/)\r\n\r\nUtterances is ready to go now.\r\n\r\n## Add Utterances in a React App\r\n\r\n- Load the Utterances script in a component within `componentDidMount`\r\n\r\n```\r\ncomponentDidMount() {\r\n        let script = document.createElement(\"script\");\r\n        let anchor = document.getElementById(\"inject-comments-for-uterances\");\r\n        script.setAttribute(\"src\", \"https://utteranc.es/client.js\");\r\n        script.setAttribute(\"crossorigin\", \"anonymous\");\r\n        script.setAttribute(\"async\", true);\r\n        script.setAttribute(\"repo\", [USER_NAME/REPO_NAME]);\r\n        script.setAttribute(\"issue-term\", [UNIQUE_ID]);\r\n        script.setAttribute(\"theme\", [THEME]);\r\n        anchor.appendChild(script);\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nI use `creat-react-app` to build the blog and use the `hash-router` in `react-router-dom` so there could be some issue when loading the comment widget.\r\n\r\nThe parameters after `#` would be ignored and Utterances bot will reference `url` or `path` to the root/base URL and all posts will load the same comments.\r\n\r\nTherefore, at the `issue-term` attribute, we must provide an unique ID of the post `UNIQUE_ID` so that the Utterances bot could reference to each posts and create issue independently.\r\n\r\n- After loading the scripts, the comments are now ready to be rendered as below.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<div id=\"inject-comments-for-uterances\">\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow the comment widget should have shown on the page and everything is done.\r\n\r\n![](https://i.imgur.com/BEwSuJh.png)\r\n\r\n## Reference\r\n\r\n[example for react use #161](https://github.com/utterance/utterances/issues/161)\r\n\r\n[2 Pages have same comments #119](https://github.com/utterance/utterances/issues/119)\r\n\r\n###### tags: `Web`"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3649515864"]}
